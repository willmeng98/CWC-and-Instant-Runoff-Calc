# CWC-and-Instant-Runoff-Calc

The Instant Runoff Voting System is one way of holding an election and is commonly considered as one of the fairest methods to run the election. In an Instant Runoff system, each voter submits his or her own preference table that ranks all of the candidates. To calculate the winner of the election, all the preference tables are then taken and the candidate with the least amount of first place vote is eliminated. The candidate is then taken off from every single preference table and this process is repeated until only one candidate is left.

On the other hand, the Condorcet Winner Criterion is one of the most basic criterions for holding what is considered a fair election. The Condorcet Winner is a candidate that will win against any other candidate in a head to head contest. However, the Condorcet Winner does not always exist and even when it does, it is not always elected by the Instant Runoff Voting System. 

This program finds how often a Condorcet Winner exists and how often an Instant Runoff Voting method will elected the Condorcet Winner in a given election with an inputed number of candidates and an inputed number of voters. 

One may also find additional information about my project in in Research.docx

Instructions:
Open CalcE.java
Change the number of Voters and Candidates in an election in line 189.
Change the number of trials in line 183

The program will then print the results of the election.

Enjoy!
